# Ask Me Anything

Hi, Iâ€™m Koen. Use this repository to _ask me anything_.

* [Ask a question](https://github.com/koendecouck/ama/issues/new)
* [Read answers](https://github.com/koendecouck/ama/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed)
* [Read great questions](https://github.com/koendecouck/ama/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22great%20question%22%20)

I get a lot of email, often asking questions that I either may have answered
before, or whose answers might be of use to a wider audience. By asking your
question(s) in this repository, we can open source our conversations.

Feel free to ask me anything at all: careers, business, code, tooling, setup,
workflows, etc. Just keep it sensible, polite, and clean.

You can read more about me on [my website](https://koendecouck.github.io/), and
[follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/koendecouck).

Speak soon,
